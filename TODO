To do first during testing week:

- rename difficulty levels with easier sounding names (easy, medium, hard)
*- More feedback when answering.
+*- Progress during playlist.
+- Logout (dropdown in user).

                - ??? Remove playlists link from navbar ???
                +*- Show # of videos in playlist card.
                - Remove tags from playlists card.

                +- Highlight (or something) 'Next' button after answering.
                +*- Warning if leaving playlist during reproduction.

                +- Make everything fit in a screen.
